<h1>Stuff you could do that's not in the instructions</h1>
<p>Here's a few things you could do to modify the kit, if you wanted. These are only suggestions, so make sure you research and think things through before diving in to any changes. <b>If you mess it up, it's your own fault.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Replace the trimmers with pots and mount them on the enclosure (or whatever) so you can manually adjust the output on the fly</li>
  <li>Put LEDs (and a current limiting resistors, of course) in the output signal path you so you can have visual feedback of the random output</li>
  <li>Build the enclosure instead of buying a premade one ... you might have scrap wood around or you could buy offcuts from a hardware/DIY store.</li>
  <ul><li>Look through charity shops or go to flea markets, you could put it in an old jewerly box or similar.</li>
      <li>Dollar stores or craft stores usually sell premade balsa or pressboard craft boxes that work well. Throw some stain and sealer on there and they don't look half bad.</li></ul>
  <li>I guess that's all for now, I'll add more suggestions here if I think of anything.</li>
</ul>
