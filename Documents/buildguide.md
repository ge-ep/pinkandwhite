<h1>Build Guide</h1>
<p>Here's my suggested build guide for the Pink and White noise generator. It would be a good idea to read through the buiild guide from top to bottom <i>before</i> you start building. Just sayin'.

<h2>Tools:</h2>
<p>You'll need the following tools:</p>
<p><li>A soldering iron</li>
   <li>Solder</li>
   <li>Some form of tip cleaner (a wet soldering sponge or brass wool (my prefered option))
   <li>Wire snippers (flush cut snippers are probably best, but anything roughly craft sized will do. You could even get away with using scissors if you're in a pinch</li></li></p>
<p>The following would also be helpful, but aren't crucial:</p>
<p><li>Helping hands</li>
   <li>Tip tinner</li>
   <li>Flux and some desoldering braid in case you need to remove a component or remove some solder from an overzealous join</li>
   <li>A bright light (it really helps when you can see what you're doing)</li>
   <li>Anti-static mat</li>
   <li>90% isopropyl alcohol and a clean toothbrush. You can use these to clean the PCB after you're done building</li></p>

   <h2>Part 0: Gather Ye Together Yon Components and Hear My Tale</h2>
   <p>Start by gathering together all of your stuff; your tools, all the components and make sure you aren't missing anything. It also helps to have a clean worksurface </p>
   <p><li></li></p>
   <h2>Part 1: Let the Soldering ..... COMENCE!</h2>
   <p>Generally, the rule with solding PCBS is <i>low to high</i>, so we start with the components that lay flattest against the PCB, and work our way up. So, with that in mind
   <p><li>Start with the three resistors</li>
      <li>And then the diode <li>making sure to match the <b>stripe on the diode</b> with the <b>stripe on the PCB</b></li></li></p>
