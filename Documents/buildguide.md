<h1>Build Guide</h1>
<p>Here's my suggested build guide for the Pink and White noise generator. It would be a good idea to read through the buiild guide from top to bottom <i>before</i> you start building. Just sayin'.

<h2>Tools:</h2>
<p>You'll need the following tools:</p>
<p><li>A soldering iron</li>
   <li>Solder</li>
   <li>Some form of tip cleaner (a wet soldering sponge or brass wool (my prefered option))
   <li>Wire snippers (flush cut snippers are probably best, but anything roughly craft sized will do. You could even get away with using scissors if you're in a pinch</li></li></p>
<p>If you are going to install the Pink and White in a 125B Hammond-style enclosure you'll also need:</p>
<ul><li>A drill of some kind, your standard power drill will do just fine</li>
    <li>Drill bits (I suggest something small to drill a pilot hole and a stepped drill bit)</li>
    <li>A center punch</li>
    <li>A marker or a pencil</li>
    <li>A ruler or measuring tape</li></ul>
<p>The following would also be helpful, but aren't crucial:</p>
<p><li>Helping hands</li>
   <li>Tip tinner</li>
   <li>Flux and some desoldering braid in case you need to remove a component or remove some solder from an overzealous join</li>
   <li>A bright light (it really helps when you can see what you're doing)</li>
   <li>Anti-static mat</li>
   <li>90% isopropyl alcohol and a clean toothbrush. You can use these to clean the PCB after you're done building</li></p>

   <h2>Part 0: Gather Ye Together Yon Components and Hear My Tale</h2>
   <p>Start by gathering together all of your stuff; your tools, all the components and make sure you aren't missing anything. It also helps to have a clean worksurface </p>
   <p><li></li></p>
   <h2>Part 1: Let the Soldering ..... COMENCE!</h2>
   <p>Generally, the rule with solding PCBS is <i>low to high</i>, so we start with the components that lay flattest against the PCB, and work our way up. So, with that in mind
   <p><ol>
      <li>Start with the three resistors</li>
      <li>And then the diode <i>making sure to match the <b>stripe on the diode</b> with the <b>stripe on the PCB</b></i></li>
      <li>Next we'll flip the PCB over and solder in the two trimmers; I like to do these now since they're the only thing on that side of the board and you'll have more space to work with.</li>
      <li>The IC sockets are next. Make sure to match the notch on the socket to the notch on the silkscreen.
      <ul><li>I like to solder one pin then check to ensure the socket is flat against the PCB. If it isn't just reheat the solder on the pin while applying gentle pressure. You should feel the socket seat 
      itself flat against the PCB</li></ul>
      <li>The voltage regulator comes next. Insert the legs and gently bend it down so the plastic housing rests against the pcb. You can use the outline on the silkscreen as a guide. </li>
      <li>Now you can do the 100nf capacitors.</li>
      <li>Then the 1nf capacitor</li>
      <li>And then the 10uf capacitor
          <ul><li><b>Please note</b>: the 10uf capacitor is polarized, you need to match the short leg of the capacitor to the filled section of the footprint on the silkscreen</ul></li>
      <p><b>**From here the steps assume that you're going to install the Pink and White in a 125B Hammond-style enclosure**</b></p></li></ol> 
     <li></li>
   
   </ol>
